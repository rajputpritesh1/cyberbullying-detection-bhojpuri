# üõ°Ô∏è Cyberbullying Detection System (Bhojpuri Text)

A machine learning-based web application that detects cyberbullying in **Bhojpuri (Devanagari script)** text using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF Vectorization**. Built with Flask and deployed for real-time predictions.

---

## üìò Detailed Report

### 1. üß† Problem Statement

The goal is to build a Cyberbullying Detection model to detect cyberbullying in user-generated text data using Logistic Regression. With the rapid growth of Bhojpuri speakers on social media platforms, cyberbullying has become a serious concern, affecting individuals' mental health and overall well-being. This project aims to identify and classify harmful or offensive content from Bhojpuri text, helping to create a safer and more positive online environment. The model will distinguish between bullying and non-bullying content based on linguistic patterns, enabling early detection and potential intervention.

### 2. üìÇ Dataset Overview

We created a curated dataset manually by extracting Bhojpuri text from a variety of online sources including YouTube comments, social media posts, regional blogs, and public forums. The dataset consists of 9241 rows and two main columns:

- **text**: Bhojpuri sentences written in Devanagari script
- **label**: Binary classification ‚Äî 1 for bully, 0 for not bully

Each data point was carefully reviewed and annotated to ensure labeling accuracy. The text samples represent a diverse set of language expressions, including slang and colloquial terms commonly used in Bhojpuri.
